# CSS-Worksheet-UN-Starter-Main-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A practical exercise focused on applying custom CSS styling to a page built with semantic HTML5 elements. The lab emphasizes best practices for both visual presentation and meaningful document structure—key skills for modern, accessible web development.

## Description

This project guides you through styling a UNESCO-themed HTML worksheet using **semantic HTML** elements (such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.) and custom **CSS**. Avoided generic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` where possible to leverage semantic alternatives. Created code that is both visually engaging and meaningfully structured for browsers, assistive technologies, and developers.

---

## Features

- Application of CSS rules to style a semantically structured webpage
- Use of HTML5 semantic elements for clear content hierarchy and improved accessibility
- Practice separating content structure (HTML) from visual styling (CSS)
- Improved maintainability and readability of code through semantic markup

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 (used semantic elements, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- CSS3

## Why Semantic HTML?

> Using semantic elements in HTML clarifies both the meaning and the structure of your content—for browsers, developers, and assistive technologies. This approach leads to better accessibility, maintainability, and SEO, and is considered a fundamental modern web standard.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

- Practiced writing and styling HTML using the most descriptive elements for each content section.
- Improved understanding of the distinction between structure (semantic HTML) and presentation (CSS).
- Recognized the role of semantic markup in building accessible and future-proof web applications.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand to responsive design with media queries and flexbox.
- Will add interactive elements and accessibility features for an even richer user experience.
- Integrate more advanced concepts like CSS variables or grid layouts.
